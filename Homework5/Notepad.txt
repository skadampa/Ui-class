4)	Diff between article, section, div?

Article element specifies independent, self-contained content like news blog or a forum. Section is to define a section in a document like breaking the content into different sections. And div defines the division or a section in an HTML document

7)	Differences between html4 and html5? explain in more details?

html 4 and html 5 are two different versions which are compatible with most of the browsers, however html5 is the new addition made to html4 to derive better performance and results. Doctype declaration was too long in html 4, when compared to html 5 so as the same with character encoding. Audio and video are not part of html4 which can be played using the third-party tool such as adobe, whereas in html5 multimedia features are provided inbuilt and are performed using the audio and video tags.HTML5 introduces number of APIs that help in creating Web applications. These can be used together with the new elements introduced for applications. Adding new elements with useful semantics â€“ <article>, <section>, <header>, <aside>, and <nav> should replace most <div>s used on a web page, making the pages a bit more semantic, but more importantly, easier to read.
