explain with examples about all properties and methods of strings and arrays

For Array

Properties

The array length property sets or returns the number of elements in an array. It represents an unsigned, 32-bit integer that is always numerically greater than the highest index in the array.

The Array.prototype property represents the prototype for the Array constructor and allows you to add new properties and methods to all Array objects.
The @@unscopable symbol property contains property names that were not included in the ECMAScript standard prior to the ES2015 version. These properties are excluded from with statement bindings.

Methods

The fill() method fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value.
arr.fill(value)
arr.fill(value, start)
arr.fill(value, start, end)

The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end (end not included). The original array will not be modified.
arr.slice()
arr.slice(begin)
arr.slice(begin, end)

The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
arr.indexOf(searchElement)
arr.indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)

The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.
arr.includes(searchElement)
arr.includes(searchElement, fromIndex)

The find() method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned
arr.find(callback[, thisArg])

The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element
arr.forEach(function callback(currentValue, index, array) {
    //your iterator
}[, thisArg]);

The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.
arr.lastIndexOf(searchElement)
arr.lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
var new_array = arr.map(callback[, thisArg])

The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first.
a.reverse()

The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
array.splice(start)
array.splice(start, deleteCount)
array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)

For String

Properties

The String.prototype property represents the string prototype object. All string instances inherit from String.prototype. Changes to the String prototype object are propagated to all string instances.
The length property represents the length of a string
str.length

This property returns the number of code units in the string, the string format used by JavaScript, uses a single 16-bit code unit to represent the most common characters, but needs to use two code units for less commonly-used characters, so it's possible for the value returned by length to not match the actual number of characters in the string.
Methods

The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
/** 
 * str: String
 * count: Number
 */

let resultString = str.repeat(count)

The codePointAt() method returns a non-negative integer that is the Unicode code point value
str.codePointAt(pos)

The link() method creates a string representing the code for an <a> HTML element to be used as a hypertext link to another URL.
str.link(url)

The includes() method determines whether one string may be found within another string, returning true or false as appropriate.
str.includes(searchString[, position])

The match() method retrieves the matches when matching a string against a regular expression
str.match(regexp)

The normalize() method returns the Unicode Normalization Form of a given string (if the value isn't a string, it will be converted to one first).
str.normalize([form])

The startsWith() method determines whether a string begins with the characters of another string, returning true or false as appropriate.
str.startsWith(searchString[, position])

The localeCompare() method returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in sort order.
referenceStr.localeCompare(compareString[, locales[, options]])

The search() method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and this String object.
str.search(regexp)

The toLowerCase() method returns the calling string value converted to lower case.
str.toLowerCase()
